Datasets are used in combination with the Data Chart widget.
They are intended to present data over time
so users can observe paterns and use the real-time data to act.
Datasets are not meant to replace proper data
logging and report products such as Grafana. Datasets
are not meant for deep analysis over large volunes of data.
They are meant as a value indicator that is backed by short historical view 
offering visual cues over trends and enhence decision making.

Create a dataset to collect a series of data points over time for a given path. You could collect
 speed through water in real time every 5 secondes. This dataset can then feed the Data Chart widget
to draw a line graph chart in real time.

# Configuration Options
The first step when defining a dataset is to select
the time scale.
